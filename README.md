This library creates PWM signal of variable frequency and duty cycle.
- Uses timer1
- for Atmega328
- You can modify functions which are called to turn pin on/off by changing MACRO_PINON(), MACRO_PINOFF() in Pulser.h
- Useful for precise frequency and duty modulation.
- Great for driving Solid State Tesla Coils.
